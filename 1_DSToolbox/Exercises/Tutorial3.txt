###Question 1
We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. We observe that there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether they have lung cancer. We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population. We explain we think that the reason for this relationship is because cigarette smoke contains known carcinogens such as arsenic and benzene, which make cells in the lungs become cancerous.

This is an example of an inferential data analysis.

###Question 2
What is the most important thing in Data Science?
The question you are trying to answer.

###Question 3
If the goal of a study was to relate Martha Stewart Living Subscribers to Our Site's Users based on the number of people that lived in each region of the US, what would be the potential problem? 
There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.	
We would be data dredging because we collected data on thousands of places in the United States.			
We would be performing inference on the relationship between Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.			
We couldn't be sure whether subscribing to Martha Steward Living causes people to be Users of Our Site or the other way around.

###Question 4
What is an experimental design tool that can be used to address variables that may be confounders at the design phase of an experiment?
Fixing variables.

###Question 5
The price and difficulty of collecting and storing data has dramatically dropped.
