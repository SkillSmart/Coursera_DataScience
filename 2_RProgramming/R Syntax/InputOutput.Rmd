# R Data IO

## Table of Contents
###Input functions
Principal Funcition to read data into R

* `read.table`, `read.csv` for reading tabular data
* `readLines` for reading lines of a text file
* `source` for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
* `dget` for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
* `load` for reading in saved workspaces
* `unserialize` for reading in single R objects in binary form

There are of course many R packages that have been developed to read in datasets, and you might want 
to resort to them when needed. 


###Output functions
Analogous, there are specific functions for *writing to files*:

* `write.table` for writing tabular data to text files (i.e. CSV)
* `writeLines` for writing character data line-by-line to a file or connection
* `dump` for dumping a ntextual reapresentation fo multiple R objects
* `dput` for outputting a textual representation of an R object
* `save` for saving an arbitrary numbe rof R objects in binary fomart (possibly compressed) to a file
* `serialize` for converting a R object into a binary foramt for outputting to a connection (or file)

###IO Packages in R (Deepdive)

## Input Functions (~ Data Import)
### Reading Data files with `read.table()`

The `read.table()` command is the most commonly used functions for reading in data in R. 
The helpfile is worth reading in its entirety, especially because the function gets used a lot.

**TODO: Add the information from the help file in this document **

The `read.table()` function has a couple of important attributes:

* *file* the name of a file, or a connection handler object
* *header*, lobical indicating if the file has a header line
* *sep*, a string indicating how the columns are seperated
* *colClasses*, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
* *nrows*, the number of rows in the dataset. By default read.table() reads an entire file. 
* *comment.char*, a character string indicating the comment character. Defaults to '#'
* *skip*, the number of lines to skip before starting to read out content
* *stringsAsFactors*, should character variables be coded as factors? Defaults to `TRUE` because back in the old dayas, if you had data that were stored as strings,
it was because they represented levels of a factor. When working with text variables, set this to FALSE and assign factor levels to the suitable variables manually.


When working with small to medium sized datasets, you do not have to worry about setting any other parameters to the `read.table()` function call. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- read.table('/data/foo.txt')
```


#### Reading larger Datasets with `read.table()`

With much larger datasets, there are a few things that you can do that will make your life easier and prevent memory runouts.

* Read the help page for `read.table()`,  #### TODO: ADD THIS INFORMATION HERE!!!!
* Make a rough calculation of the memory requirements. If this exceeds the memory on your machine, stop right here.
* Set comment.char = "" if there are no commented lines in your files
* us the `colClasses = "numeric"` argument, this can make read.table() run much faster. For this to work you have to know the classes
of each variable. 

Here is a quick and easy way to get a picture of all variable classes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First load just the head of the table. e.g. the first 100 lines
initial <- read.table('datatable.txt', nrows=100)

# Then apply the class function to all columns and store the result in a vector
classes <- sapply(initial, class)

# Load the complete dataset and "manually" define the class for each column, useing the vector
tabAll <- read.table('datatable.txt', colClasses = classes)
```

In general you want to look out for options to reduce the load on the current RAM while performing the data read.

* How much memory is available on your system? 
* What other applications are in use? Can you close any of them? 
* Are there other users logged into the same system? 
* What operating system are you using? Some operatingsystems can limit the amount of memory a single process can access

#### How to calculate the Memory Requirements for an R Object

Remember, R stores all data in physical memory, which severely limits the amount of data you can read in. Before reading in a new dataset, 
you should first calculate the Memory requirements, as R will not take notice until it has run out and all progress on the task will be lost. 

This short and easy calculation should give you a working approximation:

* Double precission floating numbers are stored in 64bit format, or 8 bytes. 

Given that information, we can calculate the requirements with the following formula:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Given a data.table(t) we calculate the amount of necessary MB with
nrows(t) * ncol(t) * 8 / 2^20 # To calculate to MB
```

Take into account the current minimum requirements of all other:

* running programs
* the general amount of unassigned RAM on your system (After the initial Memory needs of your operating system)
