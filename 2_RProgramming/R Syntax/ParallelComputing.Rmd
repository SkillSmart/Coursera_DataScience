## R Parallel Computing on local and remote multicore systems

This section adresses current applications to parrallelize workloads in R on both local multi-core & multi-gpu workstations, 
as well as how to implement distributed storage architectures like hadoop, hive, etc... from an R perspective. 

#### The parallel package in R
[see the vignette for more details](file:///C:/Program%20Files/R/R-3.2.4/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf)

Lots of work has been done to enable parallel implementations of hight troughput functions in R. 

* `lapply()`, now available  are `parLapply(cl, x, FUN, ...)` & `mclapply(X, FUN, ..., mc.cores)`(not available on Windows)
* `sapply()`
* `apply()`
