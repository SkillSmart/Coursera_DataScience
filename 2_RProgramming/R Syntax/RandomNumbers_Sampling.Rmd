## Working with Random Numbers in R

###Sampling Data
```{r}
# Generate two input vectors
x <- rnorm(1000); y <- rep(NA,1000)

# Randomnly combine them into a datavector
my_data <- sample(c(x,y), 100)
```

###Generating random samples

```{r}
# Sampling a collection of random integers over a given length
sample(10)
sample(10, replace=TRUE)
sample(10,size = 5)

# This can also take into account different likelyhoods
ratio <- c(0.7, 0.3)
s <- sample(2, size=50, replace=TRUE, prob=ratio)
paste("The ratio of 1 in this sample is :",sum(s[s==1])/length(s))
paste("The ratio of 2 in this sample is :", sum(s[s==2])/length(s))
sum(s[s==1])/length(s) 
sum(s[s==2])/length(s)
```



###Sampling Distributions

####Sampling from a gausssian Distribution
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)

```
