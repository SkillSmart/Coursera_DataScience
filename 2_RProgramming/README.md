R Programming for DataScience
------------------
Author: Frank Fichtenmueller
Status: In Progress
Start: 29/10/2016


This repo is a collection of ongoing learnings with the application of the R Language for DataScience. 

It is the condensed learning from all current work applications, and is supposed to be a storage of project ready code for everyday applications, with all necessary background information. 

In this manner, the following structure is currently being followed:

* The folder "Packages in R" links to related application scenarios given a domain specific package i have worked with

* The folder "R Syntax" contains a growing collection of Markdown Files describing the specific application of common functionalities with the R language.


Process of development:

As new learnings are made on an ongoing project, the code base is included into the Repo for later reference. When available, the tutorial information, or documentation info used to arrive at that solution is also included together with the code.
