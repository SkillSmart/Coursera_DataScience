```{r}
require(grid)

# To draw an object, we have to first create it
my_circle <- circleGrob(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, r = 0.5, 
                        gp = gpar(col = "gray", lty = 2))

# And then call the grid.draw() function on it
grid.draw(my_circle)

# Draw a rectangle with rectGrob
my_rect <- rectGrob(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 0.8, height = 0.3)
grid.draw(my_rect)
