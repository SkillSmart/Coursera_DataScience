Here i am going trough a sample analysis of the content of the NycFlights13 Dataset
```{r}
#Loading the library and the dataset in dplyr df_table format
# if(require("nycflight13") == FALSE) {install.packages("nycflights13")}
if(require("dplyr") == FALSE) {print('required packages not installed, will install now');install.packages("dplyr")} else {print('package installed and loaded')}
flights <- tbl_df(flights)
```
First we look get an overview of the dataset
* Looking at the dimension of the table
* The variables included (name, type, factor levels if categorial)
* The timerange of the dataset
* The summary statistics for each variable
* The amount of missing data
* 
```{r}

```
