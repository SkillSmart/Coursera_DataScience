The NYC Flights Dataset

------------------------
Author: Frank Fichtenmueller
Status: In progress
StartDate: 29/10/2016



As a fairly complex dataset, i am using the NYC Flights index to integrate the learned skills in Analytical work with R with a focus on the application of:

 * Dataintegration with the tidyr package
 * Dataaugmentation with the dplyr package
 * Datavisualization with the ggplot2 package


The scope of my work here is in the preparation and exploratory phase of the dataset prepartation. 

Eventually i will continue the work on this dataset into the development of interactive visualizations using:

 * Interactive HTML Documents in Markdown
 * Interactive Application Design in Shiny


So far i have integrated data from the following sources:

 * [nycflights13 dataset](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html)
 * [openflights project](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/tree/master/data)
 *
