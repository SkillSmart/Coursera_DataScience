## Data Science - Project Ready code base for common DataScience Applications

This Repo is the representation of my ongoing work on DataScience Applications. 

#### Current Status: This repo has been constructed from old content derived from the Coursera Specialization in DataScience, and is currently redone. 

###Goal with this project: 

It is my focus to integrate the learning from different MOOCS with my ongoing work in DataAnalytics in a way, that allows for fastpaced
recreation of common codeing scenarios. 
My aim is to add specific codeing solutions to this repo as a growing code base, and be able to use it to compare, discuss and enhance specific solutions with fellows. 
As the field is constantly evolving, new packages are developed daily, i want to focuss on beeing able to easily work across different programming languages in an integrated fashion. 

### Current scope of Language  
I am working with the following languages which i will be updating content for:

* Languages
  * R
  * Python 2.7
  * Octave

* Libraries in R
  * dplyr
  * ggplot2
  * sem
  * psych
  * caret

* Libraries in Python
  * scikit-learn
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scipy


### Current scope of Applications
Currently i am working on writing up the codebase for basic applications in:
 * Machine Learning Applications in Supervised Learning (caret package)
 * Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction & Component Analysis (implementations in psych & caret) 

Currently i am updating the application of:
 * Propabilistic Graphical Models on Expert System Application
 * Recurrent Neural Network for Timeline Data
 * Propabilistic Models in NLP Applications
